elm-highchart
=============

A simple dynamic chart with highcharts but with most of the code done in elm

It is just a proof of concept.

To play with it download [elm-platform](http://elm-lang.org/Install.elm), 
clone the repo somewhere and launch `elm-reactor`:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/yogsototh/elm-highchart
cd elm-highchart
elm-reactor
~~~

Now you should look at reactor at <http://localhost:8000>.
First click on `Test.elm` to compile it, then open the `index.html` file in your browser.

Enjoy.
